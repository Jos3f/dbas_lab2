# dbas_lab2

This was a lab in a database course. It is a booking system for an imaginary company where you can book a room, select participants, delete bookings and more. 

Run backendScript.js with node js and open index.html to run the booking application. You must have a SQL database running in order for this to work. Mariadb was used for this lab. The web application is initially filled with data from the database. The database schema can be found in relations.png and the database export is lab2.sql in this repo.
